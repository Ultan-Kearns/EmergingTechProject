\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wiki Article discussing MNIST, what it is and it's background
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database}{Wikipedia link to MNIST} -
this article gave me a background into the MNIST database and helped me to understand
it's usage in AI.
\item Flask API documentation \href{https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/}{Link to API documentation} - This documentation taught me a lot about Flask and how to use it.
\item Keras Documentation Site \href{https://keras.io/}{Link to Keras Documentation} - Taught me a lot about what Keras is and how I can best utilize it in my project.
\item Tensorflow Website \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{Link to Tensorflow Website} This really helped me to install tensorflow and taught me how to use it.
\end{itemize}
\section{Implementation}
When I started this project I first started by preparing the Jupyter notebook and then I added a Flask GUI which
I intend to use for the canvas to allow users to draw digits for the AI to test.
